I'm a Bachelor's Degree Radio Engineering Student.

In August, 2017 I took a gap year at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technhology and went for a one-year software engineering internship in Cisco, San Jose, California. 

I will be in the U.S. up to August, 2018. If you are interested in hiring me for an internship or being my PhD advisor, dm me.
