I'm a Bachelor's Degree Radio Engineering Student.

In August, 2017 I took a gap year at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technhology and went for a one-year software engineering internship in Cisco, San Jose, California. 

I will be in the U.S. up to August, 2018. From September, 2018 I'm in Moscow.
If you are interested in hiring me for an internship or being my PhD advisor, dm me.
